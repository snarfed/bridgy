Thank you for investigating Bridgy's security! We appreciate any and all reports of vulnerabilities. The code is open source (https://github.com/snarfed/bridgy), feel free to try to break in, let us know if you succeed!

A few guidelines for your report to qualify for a monetary reward:

* Vulnerabilities must be in the application itself, not unrelated services like email (eg SPF/DKIM/DMARC).
* Out of scope: rate limiting, XSS/CSRF attacks (Bridgy has no authenticated sessions), /admin/* pages.
* User data is intentionally public. That's not a vulnerability.
* No automated fuzzing, DoSes, or other high volume traffic. We block this traffic, and it will disqualify you from any possible award.
